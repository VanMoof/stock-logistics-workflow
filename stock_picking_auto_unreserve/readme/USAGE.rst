To use this module, you need to:

#. add some user to the group `Auto unreserve pickings`
#. those users will see a button `Unreserve others` on the picking form next to
   `Check availability` which will either unreserve pickings from the current
   location and assign the picking, or raise of it's not possible to unreserve
   enough stock.
